            <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
            <p><br>I'm a results-driven management professional living, working and adventuring in the beautiful Beehive State.  I work with a local company that provides branding solutions for ATMs and retail banking environments across the U.S. and Canada.  I manage our brand management and compliance division which focuses on maintenance, compliance and repair services for ATMs and branding for our clients.
              <br><br> These responsibilities include, <i>inter alia,</i> managing an overseas development team working on our proprietarty service platform and iOS applications.  When not chained to my desk I can be found exploring our beautiful state; camping, cycling and adventuring in multiple forms.</p>

            <h2>My Work - CAMS Web Platofrm</h2>
            <p>CAMS is an asset-management interface used by bank and credit unions to view, sort, filter, and take remediation action on non-compliance issues identified through regular service visits.  Users are presented with a dashboard organizing action items into coherent categories that allow quick visual assessment of issues across their fleet of ATMs.
                <br><br> Users can review individual ATM service history and photos and download service reports.  Highly granular service data and images can be queried giving the user a high degree of visibility into their entire fleet of ATMs.

            <h2>My Work - CAMS iOS App</h2>
            <p>The CAMS iOS app is the partner to the CAMS Web Platform. The app allows service technicians to complete assigned service visits efficiently by providing an overview map, site list and navigation features.
            <br><br>Technicians complete highly customizable surveys via the app, answering questions and taking relevant photos in a tightly controlled workflow.  Data and images are synched to AWS resources seamlessly, giving ATM network managers near real-time insight into service visit data across their national fleet.
